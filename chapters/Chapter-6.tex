\chapter{Development of Resonant Cavities for Large Volume CRES Measurements}

\section{Introduction}

The cavity approach is an alternative CRES measurement technology under consideration by the Project 8 collaboration for a neutrino mass measurement experiment with 40~meV sensitivity. After pursuing an antenna array based CRES demonstrator design for several years the increasing costs and complexity of the antenna arrays led to a rexamination of resonant cavities for a large scale experiment. Currently, a cavity based CRES experiment is the preferred technology for the Project 8 neutrino mass measurement goal with antennas as a fall-back approach. 

In this chapter we provide a brief summary of resonant cavities and sketch out the key features of a cavity based CRES experiment. In Section \ref{sec:chap6-resonant-cavities} we provide a brief introduction to cylindrical resonant cavities and the solutions for the electromagnetic fields in the cavity volume.

In Section \ref{sec:chap6-cavity-approach} we describe the main components of a cavity based CRES experiment. Including the background and trap magnets, cavity geometry and design, and cavity coupling considerations. We also discuss some relevant trade-offs between an antenna array and cavity CRES experiment, and highlight some reasons for the transition of Project 8 to the development of a cavity based experiment.

Finally, in Sections \ref{sec:chap6-single-mode-cavity-sims} and \ref{sec:chap6-single-mode-cavity-measurement} I present the design and development of an open, mode-filtered cavity that could be used in a cavity based CRES experiment. The results of the cavity simulations are confirmed by laboratory measurements of a proof-of-principle prototype cavity intended to demonstrate key features of the design.

\section{Cylindrical Resonant Cavities}
\label{sec:chap6-resonant-cavities}

Resonant cavities are essentially sealed conductive containers, which allows us to describe the electromagnetic (EM) fields as a superposition of resonant modes. The field shapes of the resonant modes are determined by Maxwell's equations and the boundary conditions enforced by the cavity geometry. Of interest to Project 8 for CRES measurements are cylindrical cavities due to their ease of construction and integration with atom and electron trapping magnets. 

\subsection{General Field Solutions}

Consider a long segment of conducting material with a cylindrical cross-section (see Figure \ref{fig:chap6-circ-waveguide}). A geometry such as this can be used as a waveguide transmission line to transfer EM energy from point to point, or, if conducting shorts are inserted on both ends of the cylinder, the waveguide becomes a resonant cavity. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=0.4\textwidth]{figs/Chapter-6/230606_circular_waveguide.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:chap6-circ-waveguide} Geometry of a cylindrical waveguide with radius $b$. }
\end{figure}

The fields allowed inside a cylindrical cavity are determined by the boundary conditions of the cylindrical geometry. The general approach to solving for the fields begins by assuming solutions to Maxwell's equations of the form
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:chap6-maxwell-eqn-solutions-E}\bm{E}(x,y,z)&=(\bm{e}(x,y)+\hat{z}e_z(x,y))e^{-i\beta z},\\
    \label{eq:chap6-maxwell-eqn-solutions-H}\bm{H}(x,y,z)&=(\bm{h}(x,y)+\hat{z}h_z(x,y))e^{-i\beta z}.
\end{align}

The solutions assume a harmonic time dependence of the form $e^{i\omega t}$ and propagation along the positive z-axis. The functions $\bm{e}(x,y)$ and $\bm{h}(x,y)$ represent the transverse ($\hat{x}, \hat{y}$) components of the electric and magnetic fields respectively, and $e_z(x,y)$, $h_z(x,y)$ are the longitudinal components. The version of Maxwell's equations in the case where there are no source terms can be written as a pair of coupled differential equations, 
\begin{align}
    \nabla\times\bm{E}&=-i\omega\mu\bm{H},\\
    \nabla\times\bm{H}&=i\omega\epsilon\bm{E},
\end{align}
where $\epsilon$ and $\mu$ are the permittivity and permeability of the material inside the waveguide or cavity. Using the field solutions from Equations \ref{eq:chap6-maxwell-eqn-solutions-E} and \ref{eq:chap6-maxwell-eqn-solutions-H} one can solve for the transverse components of the fields in terms of the longitudinal fields. Because we are interested in cylindrical cavities it is advantageous to write the field solutions in cylindrical coordinates. After performing this transformation the set of four equations for the transverse field components are,
\begin{align}
    H_\rho&=\frac{i}{k_c^2}\left(\frac{\omega\epsilon}{\rho}\frac{\partial E_z}{\partial \phi}-\beta \frac{\partial H_z}{\partial \rho}\right),\\
    H_\phi&=\frac{-i}{k_c^2}\left(\omega\epsilon\frac{\partial E_z}{\partial \rho}+\frac{\beta}{\rho}\frac{\partial H_z}{\partial \phi}\right),\\
    E_\rho&=\frac{-i}{k_c^2}\left(\beta\frac{\partial E_z}{\partial \rho}+\frac{\omega\mu}{\rho}\frac{\partial H_z}{\partial \phi}\right),\\
    E_\phi&=\frac{i}{k_c^2}\left(\frac{-\beta}{\rho}\frac{\partial E_z}{\partial \phi}+\omega\mu\frac{\partial H_z}{\partial \rho}\right),
\end{align}
where $k_c$ is the cutoff wavenumber defined by $k_c^2=k^2-\beta^2$ with $k=\omega\sqrt{\mu\epsilon}$ being the wavenumber of the EM radiation. 

This set of equations can be used to solve for a variety of different modes that can be obtained by setting conditions on $E_z$ and $H_z$. For cylindrical cavities two types of modes are allowed, which correspond to solutions where $E_z=0$ and $H_z=0$ respectively. 

\subsection{TE and TM Modes}
\label{sec:chap6-TE-TM-modes}

The TE family of modes corresponds to the case where $E_z=0$. This implies that $H_z$ is a solution to the Helmholtz wave equation 
\begin{equation}
    (\nabla^2 + k^2)H_z = 0.
    \label{eq:chap6-helmholtz-magnetic}
\end{equation}
For solutions of the form $H_z(\rho,\phi,z)=h_z(\rho,\phi)e^{-i\beta z}$, Equation \ref{eq:chap6-helmholtz-magnetic} can be solved using the standard technique of separation of variables. Rather than reproduce the derivation here we shall simply quote the solutions for the transverse fields, which are 
\begin{align}
    H_\rho &= \frac{-i\beta }{k_{c_{nm}}}(A\sin{n\phi}+B\cos{n\phi})J_n^\prime(k_{c_{nm}}\rho)e^{-i\beta_{nm} z},\\
    H_\phi &=\frac{-i\beta n}{k_{c_{nm}}^2\rho}(A\cos{n\phi}-B\sin{n\phi})J_n(k_{c_{nm}}\rho)e^{-i\beta_{nm} z},\\
    E_\rho &=\frac{-i\omega\mu n}{k_{c_{nm}}^2 \rho}(A\cos{n\phi}-B\sin{n\phi})J_n(k_{c_{nm}}\rho)e^{-i\beta_{nm} z},\\
    E_\phi &=\frac{i\omega\mu}{k_{c_{nm}}}(A\sin{n\phi}+B\cos{n\phi})J_n^\prime(k_{c_{nm}}\rho)e^{-i\beta_{nm} z}.
\end{align}
One can observe that the solutions have a periodic dependence on $\phi$, and radial profiles given by the Bessel functions of the first kind. The integer indices $n$ and $m$ arise from continuity conditions on the EM fields in the azimuthal and radial directions. For the TE modes $n\geq0$ and $m\geq1$. $k_{c_{nm}}$ is the cutoff wavenumber for the $\mathrm{TE}_{nm}$ mode given by 
\begin{equation}
    k_{c_{nm}} = \frac{p^\prime_{nm}}{b},
\end{equation}
where $b$ is the radius of the cavity or waveguide and $p^\prime_{nm}$ is the $m$-th root of the derivative of the $n$-th order Bessel function (see Table \ref{tab:chap6-bessel-derivative roots}).

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{\label{tab:chap6-bessel-derivative-roots} A table of the values of $p_{nm}^\prime$.}
    \begin{tabular}{c c c c }
        \hline
        $n$ & $p_{n1}^\prime$ & $p_{n2}^\prime$ & $p_{n3}^\prime$ \\
        \hline
        0 & 3.832 & 7.016 & 10.174\\
        1 & 1.841 & 5.331 & 8.536\\
        2 & 3.054 & 6.706 & 9.970\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The TM mode family corresponds to the case where $H_z=0$, and $(\nabla^2 +k^2)E_z=0$. Again, we assume solutions of the form $E_z(\rho,\phi,z)=e_z(\rho,\phi)e^{-i\beta z}$, for which the general form of the solutions is the same as for the TE modes. However, the different boundary conditions for the TM modes results in particular solutions with a different from, which we shall quote here without derivation. The transverse fields of the TM modes are given by 
\begin{align}
    H_\rho &=\frac{-i\omega\epsilon n}{k_{c_{nm}}^2 \rho}(A\cos{n\phi}-B\sin{n\phi})J_n(k_{c_{nm}}\rho)e^{-i\beta_{nm} z},\\
    H_\phi &=\frac{-i\omega\epsilon}{k_{c_{nm}}}(A\sin{n\phi}+B\cos{n\phi})J_n^\prime(k_{c_{nm}}\rho)e^{-i\beta_{nm} z}\\
    E_\rho &= \frac{-i\beta }{k_{c_{nm}}}(A\sin{n\phi}+B\cos{n\phi})J_n^\prime(k_{c_{nm}}\rho)e^{-i\beta_{nm} z},\\
    E_\phi &=\frac{-i\beta n}{k_{c_{nm}}^2\rho}(A\cos{n\phi}-B\sin{n\phi})J_n(k_{c_{nm}}\rho)e^{-i\beta_{nm} z},
\end{align}
which one may notice are the same solutions as the TE modes with $H$ and $E$ flipped. The cutoff wavenumber for the TM modes is given by, $k_{c_{nm}}=p_{nm}/b$, where the values of $p_{nm}$ correspond to the $m$-th zero of the $n$-th order Bessel function (see Table \ref{tab:chap6-bessel-roots}).

\subsection{Resonant Frequencies of a Cylindrical Cavity}

A cylindrical cavity is essentially constructed by taking a section of cylindrical waveguide and shorting both ends with conductive material. This means that the electric fields inside a cylindrical cavity are exactly those we derived in Section \ref{sec:chap6-TE-TM-modes} with the additional condition that the electric fields must go to zero at $z=0$ and $z=L$ (see Figure \ref{fig:chap6-cyl-cav}).
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=0.3\textwidth]{figs/Chapter-6/230606_cylindrical_cavity.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:chap6-cyl-cav} The geometry of a cylindrical cavity with length $L$ and radius $b$.}
\end{figure}

The transverse electric field solutions for a cylindrical waveguide are of the form
\begin{equation}
    \bm{E}(\rho,\phi,z)=\bm{e}(\rho,\phi)\left(A_+e^{-i\beta_{nm}z}+A_-e^{i\beta_{nm}z }\right),
\end{equation}
where $A_+$ and $A_-$ are arbitrary amplitudes of forward and backward propagating waves. In order to enforce that $\bm{E}$ is zero at both ends of the cavity we require that 
\begin{equation}
    \beta_{nm}L = 2\pi \ell,
\end{equation}
where $\ell=0,1,2,3\ldots$. Using this constraint on the propagation constant we can solve for the resonant frequencies of the $\mathrm{TE}_{nm\ell}$ and the $\mathrm{TM}_{nm\ell}$ modes in a cylindrical cavity. For the TE modes the resonant frequencies are
\begin{equation}
    f_{nm\ell}=\frac{c}{2\pi\sqrt{\mu_r\epsilon_r}}\sqrt{\left(\frac{p_{nm}^\prime}{b}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\ell\pi}{L}\right)^2},
\end{equation}
and the frequencies of the TM modes are 
\begin{equation}
    f_{nm\ell}=\frac{c}{2\pi\sqrt{\mu_r\epsilon_r}}\sqrt{\left(\frac{p_{nm}^\prime}{b}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\ell\pi}{L}\right)^2}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Cavity Q-factors}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=0.6\textwidth]{figs/Chapter-6/230607_rlc.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:chap6-series-rlc} A series RLC circuit.}
\end{figure}

The resonant behavior of cylindrical cavities can be modeled as a series RLC circuit (see figure \ref{fig:chap6-series-rlc}). The input impedance of the circuit can be obtained by applying Kirchhoff's laws to calculate the impedance of the equivalent circuit. For a series RLC circuit the input impedance is 
\begin{equation}
    Z_\mathrm{in}=\left(\frac{1}{R}+\frac{1}{i\omega L}+i\omega C\right).
\end{equation}
The resistance in the circuit represents all sources of loss in the cavity, which is primarily caused by the finite conductivity of the cavity walls, and the inductor and capacitor represent the energy stored in the cavity in the form of electric and magnetic fields. If the circuit is being driven by an external power source we can write the input power in terms of the circuit input impedance and the source voltage 
\begin{equation}
    P_\mathrm{in} = \frac{1}{2}Z_\mathrm{in}|I|^2=\frac{1}{2}|I|^2\left(\frac{1}{R}+\frac{1}{i\omega L}+i\omega C\right).
\end{equation} 
The resistor introduces a loss into the system with a power given by 
\begin{equation}
    P_\mathrm{loss} = \frac{1}{2}|I|^2R,
\end{equation}
and the capacitor and inductor store energies given by
\begin{align}
    W_e&=\frac{1}{4}\frac{|I|^2}{\omega^2 C},\\
    W_m&=\frac{1}{4}|I|^2 L,
\end{align}
respectively. Using these expressions we can write the input power and input impedance expressions in terms of the lost power and stored energy 
\begin{align}
    P_\mathrm{in}=P_\mathrm{loss}+2i\omega(W_m-W_e),\\
    Z_\mathrm{in}=\frac{P_\mathrm{loss}+2i\omega(W_m-W_e)}{\frac{1}{2}|I|^2}.
\end{align}

The condition for resonance in the RLC circuit is that the stored magnetic energy is equal to the stored electric energy ($W_e$=$W_m$). When this occurs $Z_\mathrm{in}=R$, which is a purely real impedance, and $P_{in}=P_{loss}$. The resonant frequency of the circuit can be determined from the condition $W_e=W_m$ from which one finds that 
\begin{equation}
    \omega_0=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}.
\end{equation}
An important performance parameter for any resonant system is the Q-factor, which quantifies the quality of the resonator as the ratio of the stored energy multiplied by the resonant frequency to the average energy lost per second. For the series RLC circuit, the Q-factor is given by the expression 
\begin{equation}
    Q_0=\omega\frac{W_e+W_m}{P_\mathrm{loss}}=\frac{1}{\omega_0RC},
\end{equation}
from which one observes that as the resistance of the RLC circuit is decreased the quality factor of the resonator increases. From the perspective of cylindrical cavities this implies that as one decreases the resistance of the cavity walls it is expected that the Q-factor of the cavity should increase, which is indeed the case. In certain applications where a high Q is desireable it is possible to manufacture a cavity out of superconducting materials in order to minimize the power losses of the system.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=0.6\textwidth]{figs/Chapter-6/230607_rlc_resonance.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:chap6-rlc-resonance}}
\end{figure}

The Q-factor of the resonator also determines with bandwidth (BW) of the system. A cavity with a high Q-factor will resonant with a smaller range of frequencies than a cavity with a low Q-factor. To see this we can examine the behavior of the RLC circuit when driven by frequencies near the resonance. For a frequency $\omega=\omega_0+\Delta \omega$, where $\Delta \omega=\omega-\omega_0\ll \omega_0$, we can write the input impedance as 
\begin{equation}
    Z_\mathrm{in}=R+i\omega L\left(\frac{\omega^2-\omega_0^2}{\omega^2}\right),
\end{equation}
and by expanding $(\omega^2-\omega_0^2)/\omega^2$ to first order in $\Delta\omega$, we obtain 
\begin{equation}
    Z_\mathrm{in}\approx R+i\frac{2RQ_0\Delta\omega}{\omega_0}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the magnitude of the input impedance near the resonance is given by 
\begin{equation}
    |Z_\mathrm{in}|=R\sqrt{1+4Q_0^2\frac{\Delta\omega^2}{\omega^2}}, 
    \label{eq:chap6-mag-input-impedance}
\end{equation}
from which we observe that for the series RLC circuit the input impedance is minimized at the resonant frequency, which corresponds to the maximum input power (see Figure \ref{fig:chap6-rlc-input-impedance}). The half-power BW is the range of frequencies over which the input power drops to half the input power on resonance. This occurs when $|Z_\mathrm{in}|=\sqrt{2}R$, which corresponds to $\Delta\omega/\omega=\textrm{BW}/2$. Using Equation \ref{eq:chap6-mag-input-impedance} one can find that
\begin{equation}
    2R^2=R^2(1+Q_0^2\mathrm{BW}^2),
\end{equation}
which implies
\begin{equation}
    \mathrm{BW}=\frac{1}{Q_0}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/Chapter-6/230607_loaded_rlc.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:chap6-loaded-resonator-circuit} A series RLC circuit coupled to an external circuit with input impedance $R_L$.}
\end{figure}

It is important to emphasize that the Q-factor defined here, $Q_0$, is technically the unloaded Q. It reflects the quality of the cavity or resonant circuit without the influence of any external circuitry. In practice, however, a cavity is invariably coupled to an external circuit to drive a cavity resonance or to measure the energy of a resonant mode. Coupling a cavity to an external circuit changes the Q by loading the equivalent cavity RLC circuit (see Figure \ref{fig:chap6-loaded-resonator-circuit}). The Q-factor of the cavity when it is loaded by an external circuit is called the loaded Q, which is the quantity that one actually measures when exciting a resonance in the cavity. Using the series RLC circuit model one can see that the load resistor in Figure \ref{fig:chap6-loaded-resonator-circuit} will add in series with the resistor in the circuit for a total equivalent resistance of $R+R_L$. Therefore, the loaded Q is given by 
\begin{equation}
    Q_L=\frac{1}{\omega_0(R+R_L)C},
\end{equation}
from which one observes that the loaded Q is always less than the intrinsic Q of the cavity.

The amount of coupling that is desireable depends on the specific application of the resonator. If one wants a resonator that is particular frequency selective than it makes sense to limit the amount of coupling to the cavity to maintain a small BW, alternatively, if a larger BW is need one can increase the cavity coupling by tuning the input impedance of the external circuit. The critical point, where maximum power is transferred between the cavity and the external circuit, occurs when the input impedance of the cavity matches the input impedance of the external transmission line.  For the series RLC circuit on resonance, this matching condition corresponds to 
\begin{equation}
    Z_0=Z_\mathrm{in}=R,
\end{equation}
where $Z_0$ is the impedance of the transmission line. The loaded Q at this critical point is, therefore,
\begin{equation}
    Q_L=\frac{1}{2\omega_0Z_0C}=\frac{Q_0}{2}.
\end{equation}
One can described the degree of coupling between the cavity and an external circuit by defining a coupling factor, $g$, such that,
\begin{equation}
    g=\frac{Q_0}{Q_L}-1.
\end{equation} 
When $g=1$ then $Q_L=Q_0/2$, and the cavity is said to be critically coupled as we described. If $Q_L<Q_0/2$, then the cavity is undercoupled to the transmission line, corresponding to $g<1$. Alternatively, if $Q_L>Q_0/2$, then $g>1$, and the cavity is overcoupled to the transmission line. Various specialized circuits can be used to tune the input impedance of the external circuit as seen by the cavity to achieve a wide range of different coupling factors based on the desired application of the cavity.

\section{The Cavity Approach to CRES}
\label{sec:chap6-cavity-approach}

\subsection{A Sketch of a Molecular Tritium Cavity CRES Experiment}

Resonant cavities can be used to perform CRES measurements, and they represent the current preferred technology by the Project 8 collaboration for the ultimate goal of a 40~meV neutrino mass measurement using CRES. The basic approach to a neutrino mass measurement using a resonant cavity and molecular tritium beta-decay source is illustrated by Figure \ref{fig:chap6-cav-cartoon}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics*[width=0.7\textwidth]{figs/Chapter-6/230606_cavity_cartoon.png}
    \caption{\label{fig:chap6-cav-cartoon} Caption}
\end{figure}

At the core of the experiment is a large resonant cavity filled with tritium gas. In principle a sealed metallic cavity serves a dual purpose as the tritium containment vessel although the risks of exposure to radioactive tritium may necessitate a secondary dielectric containment vessel (such as fused scilica) inside the cavity volume. The filled cavity is then placed in a uniform magnetic field provided by a primary magnet that sets the values of the cyclotron frequencies for electrons emitted with energies near the tritium spectrum endpoint. When a beta-decay electron is produced in the cavity it is trapped using an additional set of magnetic coils that prevents the electrons from running into the cavity walls.

Electrons trapped inside the cavity volume do not radiate in the same way as electron in free-space. Effectively, the same boundary conditions that were used to derive the resonant modes of a cylindrical cavity in Section \ref{sec:chap6-resonant-cavities} apply to the radiation of the electron as well. If an electron is emitted with a kinetic energy that corresponds to a cyclotron frequency that matches a resonant frequency of the cavity, then the power radiated by the electron excites the corresponding resonance in the cavity. The strength of the electron's coupling to the cavity is given by the dot product between the electrons trajectory and the electric field vector of the resonant mode. However, if an electron is moving with a cyclotron frequency that is far from any resonant modes in the cavity, then radiation from the electron is suppressed. One can interpret this somewhat surprising effect as the metallic walls of the cavity reflecting the radiated energy back into the electron. 

To detect the electron the cavity is coupled to an external transmission line that leads to an amplifier and RF receiver chain similar to an antenna array based experiment. The coupling of the cavity resonance to the amplifier occurs through a coupling probe designed to resonate with the same mode or modes excited by the electron. In other resonant cavity systems this is often accomplished using a simple wire antenna,  which could be connected to the amplifier through a segment of coaxial cable. Alternatively, cavities are oftentimes coupled to waveguides or smaller external cavities using small holes or apertures cut into the main cavity wall. For CRES measurements, the placement of a wire coupling probe inside the cavity volume leads to additional scattering of electrons and eventually tritium atoms, therefore, the apertures are the preferred coupling method for cavity CRES experiments.

One of the attractive features of the CRES technique for neutrino mass measurement is the gain in statistics that comes from the differential nature of the tritium spectrum measurement. Initially, this seems incompatible with cavities, due to the narrow resonances of cavity modes giving relatively small bandwidth. However, by intentionally overcoupling to a single cavity mode one can achieve bandwidths of a few 10's of MHz, which is sufficient for a measurement of the tritium spectrum endpoint region.
