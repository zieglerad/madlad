First, thank you to my advisor, Luiz de Viveiros. During these past years I have been deeply grateful for the freedom to pursue my own research paths, his patience and support when, inevitably, things do not go right the first time, and the reminders to keep the big picture in mind. 

Second, thank you to my friends and colleagues in the Project 8 Collaboration, who have been a genuine pleasure to work with and have contributed in enumerable ways to my dissertation and ability as a scientist. I am honored to have been a member of this team.
